# FarmSim

FarmSim is a farming simulation game written entirely in Javascript, HTML5 and
CSS6. No external framworks or libraries were used and assets were all
acquired legally. As this is basically just a prototype, a lot of functionality
is missing; such as:

* More seeds.
* Fertilizer.
* Watering functionality.
* Raking/cleaning old plot functionality.
* Better graphic assets.
* Better color layout (especially by someone not colorblind like me).
* Field expansion options (via gold).
* Challenges/quests.
* Seasons.
* etc, etc...

## Installation
Just clone it to a webdir and point your browser at the index.html file!

Unfortunatly, I'm not able to distribute all the assets legally due to the
various licenses attached to them.

## Playing the Game
Gameplay is fairly self-explanatory. For help, just click the '?' icon in the
top right corner of the page.
